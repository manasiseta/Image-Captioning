# Image-Captioning

In this project, we are attempting to determine the caption of the picture by use CNN and LSTM. 
Huge datasets and a lot of computing power are beneficial when it comes to developing models that 
can create captions for images as deep learning methods continue to advance. This is precisely the 
kind of thing we want to do in this Python-based project using deep learning algorithms like 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). An image caption 
generator is a piece of software that analyses a picture's context and writes an English caption using 
techniques from both natural language processing and computer vision. It does this by combining 
both of these types of processing. In this comprehensive study, we pay close attention to some of the 
most fundamental principles of picture captioning as well as its most prevalent methodologies. In the 
process of developing this project, we go through the Keras library, as well as numpy and jupyter 
notebooks. In addition to this, we talk about the CNN and flickr dataset that are utilised for picture 
categorization.
